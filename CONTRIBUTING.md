# Welcome to OutFox Serenity contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Here you'll learn what is needed to help with the next iterations of OutFox Serenity Pack.

First of all, please join the [OutFox Serenity Discord server](https://discord.gg/mNcFU67mK7) to have direct contact with other contributors and staff. This should help to better organize content and make things easier.

## General guidelines

[**READ OUR SERENITY GUIDELINES**](https://projectoutfox.com/serenity-guidelines)

- When cloning, don't forget to `git checkout` to the correct branch. When everything is done, it will then be merged to the main branch.
- You can open a PR as draft if you think that's better to keep us updated with your progress.
- We recommend general content to include one of the following licenses: MIT, Apache 2.0
    - Music content: CC-BY, CC-BY-SA
    - Chart content: CC-BY 3.0 or 4.0
    - Graphics content: CC-BY 3.0 or 4.0 (**If your graphics incorporate CC-BY-SA-licensed material, your graphics must instead be licensed under CC-BY-SA to comply with the license**)

## Chart Contribution Rules

- Do not forget to fill the **#AUTHOR** and **#CREDIT** tag.
- SSC format is required, however:
    - for modcharts, submit the .ssc and all the scripts/assets used.
	- use .bms/.pms for keysounded bemu/pomu charts.
	- use .dtx for keysounded gddm/gdgf charts.
- No modifications on your charts should affect other people's charts or the whole simfile itself. This means that you should avoid editing the main simfile information fields (unless required; in that case, explain why it's needed), edit the field for each chart you're contributing with instead.
