[03:21.400]This anguish I can't comprehend,
[03:24.756]my situation's forcing me to make amends.
[03:28.005]It's possible that here's where I descend,
[03:32.375]forever trapped in a long weekend.
[03:35.000]No toil, no acts from me,
[03:37.845]will ever restore or make new harmony,
[03:41.400]'cause I jumped in, and didn't slow down.
[03:46.323]Still waiting world renown.
